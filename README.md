  This is a configurable modification meant to allow users to employ electrochemical machining techniques such as milling and jet electrolysis on their 3D printer. By piggybacking off of the kinematics of widely available and owned 3D printers, implementation and adoption will be made simpler and less expensive.
  
  This repo will contain solid body models, STLs, and PCB files for any adopted control boards.
