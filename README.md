Valentine ECM Mod
## TOXICITY WARNING
ELECTROCHEMISTRY CAN BE DANGEROUS AND EVEN DEADLY. KNOW YOUR CHEMICAL PRODUCTS, WORK IN A WELL VENTILATED SPACE, AND WEAR PROPER PPE AT ALL TIMES. Machining of chromium containing alloys will produce hexavalent chromium which is just as scary as it sounds and has an extreme propensity to contaminate water and will GIVE YOU CANCER. Do not give yourself cancer, please.

Users accept all responsibility for their own safety when conducting ECM processes. Please discard waste in a legal and safe manner. 

## A Configurable Electrochemical Machining Modification

  This is a configurable modification meant to allow users to employ electrochemical machining techniques such as milling and jet electrolysis on their 3D printer. By piggybacking off of the kinematics of widely available and owned 3D printers, implementation and adoption will be made simpler and less expensive.
  
  This repo will contain solid body models, STLs, and PCB files for any adopted control boards.
